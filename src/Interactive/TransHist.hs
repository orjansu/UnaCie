  <TO-DO>: Transformation history output using paths.

  Information:
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  (1) ** WHEN THEN GLOBAL RELATION IS SET **

    - The transformation history is effectively the proof state history plus
      each command that has been executed taking the interpreter from one
      /proof/ state to the next;
    - The transformation history can be seen as a series of semi-formal
      steps of inequational reasoning of the form:

       t
         REL_i { cmd1 }
       t'
         REL_j { cmd2 }
       t''

      where t'{^n} are the proof states and REL_k { cmdX } are the
      proof hints. Here t'{^n} are stored in stateHist and REL_k { cmdX }
      are stored in cmdHist

  (2) ** WHEN THE GLOBAL RELATION IS NOT SET **

    - The transformation history simply records the term before and after
      a transformation has been executed, and tracks which command
      was responsible for the transformation and its corresponding relation;
    - Important: in this instance, the transformation history does /not/
      necessarily constitute semi-formal steps of inequational reasoning,
      but in theory /could/ if the user was careful with their inequational
      relations.

  - The transformation history can be reviewed/exported by the user at any time
  -- A warning will be printed if the history is exported when a global
     relation is not set.
  - We store paths in stateHist in order to provide a transformation history
    that reflects what the user could see on the command line in each proof
    state, as navigation commands allow us to move through a term's
    AST in order to apply transformation to specific sub-term.
