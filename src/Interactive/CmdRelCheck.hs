  Information:
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Check if a command is safe to apply by ensuring its corresponding
   relation implies the global relation;
 - Two side notes:
   (1) The global relation may not be set as we have an experimental option
       that allows users to apply transformations however they like;
   (2) Commands may /not/ have a corresponding relation e.g., shell/state
       commands as they update the interactive environment etc. and
       do /not/ affect the "proof state".

{-
  - Check if a command is safe w.r.t. the global relation
  - A command is unsafe before it is checked and safe afterwards
  - We return the RawCmd with its relation as 'evidence' of it's validity
    in the current proof context. These are then logged in the
    transformation's history for reviewing/exporting later.
